<p>Establishments in this industry are primarily engaged in the retail sale of men's,
 women's and children's footwear; these establishments frequently carry accessories,
 such as gloves, socks and hosiery.</p>
<p>Products sold in this industry fall into several general categories: athletic footwear, dress shoes, casual shoes, sandals, work/duty footwear, hiking/hunting/fishing boots, western/casual boots, and "other." While athletic shoe sales dominated the marketplace for several years, Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) reported that during the second quarter (April through June) of 1999, total spending for athletic shoes declined 10 percent, to $3.056 billion from $3.403 billion for the same period in 1998. Sales of men's models rose during that period, the association reported, but sales of women's and children's models declined.</p>
